"""Fictive stay generation — common primitives for sampling hospital stays.

This module provides shared building blocks for generating fictitious
hospital stays from PMSI data. It is used by both the Brest and AP-HP
pipelines to ensure consistent sampling logic and reduce code duplication.

Responsibilities:
- Generate fictitious hospital stays from PMSI data (Brest/AP-HP).
- Ensure consistent sampling logic across pipelines.
- Reduce code duplication between pipelines.

Public API:
- :func:`generate_fictive_stays`: Generate fictitious stays for a given pipeline.

    ----------
    data:
        Dict of LazyFrames returned by the pipeline's ``load_data`` method.
    n_sejours:
        Number of fictitious stays to generate.

        Additional pipeline-specific arguments (e.g., ``n_ccam``, ``n_das``

    Returns
    -------
    pl.DataFrame
        One row per fictitious stay. Columns depend on the pipeline type.
